# Augmented Dickey-Fuller Unit Root Test
# Tests whether a time series has a unit root, e.g. has a trend or more generally is autoregressive.

# Assumptions
# Observations in are temporally ordered.

# Interpretation
# H0: a unit root is present (series is non-stationary).
# H1: a unit root is not present (series is stationary).
