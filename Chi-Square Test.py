# Chi-Squared Test
# Tests whether two categorical variables are related or independent.

# Assumptions
# Observations used in the calculation of the contingency table are independent.
# 25 or more examples in each cell of the contingency table.

# Interpretation
# H0: the two samples are independent.
# H1: there is a dependency between the samples.
